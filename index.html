hi! it seems you've landed on my page! i'm ali hassannia, an aerospace engineering major at the university of maryland. i am so sorry the site currently looks like this, but as of Dec 13., 2021 i have decided to try and code my own website to brand myself. this is (will be) that attempt. i see it as a suitable and approachable way to showcase some originality while still being professional. as such, i appreciate your patience as i work to grow myself in and out of the professional field. as with everything, made with <3
