        <h2>Activity: How great is that song?</h2>
        
        <h3>
            Way to go by the way! The next stage is going to be a bit of a brain stretcher. 
            Summon your inner Mr. Moylan and finger slam away.

        <h2>
            But First...one last question:
        </h2>
        <p>
            After a Zac Brown concert with your parents at Merriweather Post Pavillion, we caught a ride home
            in your dad's Tesla. We also went around playing songs for the group. My choice was a very peculiar one.
            Released in 1979, the its album cover captures the dream of its members on a morning arrival to a familiar 
            island. It's apparenlty "progressive rock"...whatever that means.
            <br>
            <br>
            Anyways, remember that song for later.
        </p>

        <h2>
            The Code:
        </h2>
        <p>
            This "activity" is one of a few questions from the 1st Lab of this semester's
            coding class. I do not know the exact level of your coding expertise, so I am
            going to give you as much information as you should need, even if a novice. 
            Further, if you still seek help with this task, reach out and I can give pointers.

            For starters, you're going to want to make sure you have 2 things:
            <br>
            <br>
                1) VS Code installed
                2) Python3 installed
            <br>
            <br>
            Intallation Resources:
            <br>
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac</a>
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html">https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            And you DON'T HAVE TO use VS Code. If miss gurl prefers SubLime or another text editor,
            pop off. But some of the little things I talk about may only be applicable to VS Code. That's all.
            Also also, Python should come installed on your computer, but if you don't know or your Python is
            outdated (not up to ver.3), I included resources.
            <br>
            <br>
            You made also need to install the textstat library:
            <a href="https://pypi.org/project/textstat/">https://pypi.org/project/textstat/</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            It should be as easy as typing this into your terminal window (which you may need to populate):
            <br>
            <br>    
                pip install textstat
            <br> 
            <br>
            You will then retrieve two of the grades from this site: flesch reading ease and automated readability index.
            Save them as 2 variables respectively named: ease and index. Then print these two values.
            <br>
            The lyrics you input should be retrieved from simply looking up: song name + lyrics. 
            <br>
            We can ignore the negatives, we can ignore the decimal points, and we can ingore the zeros.
            Once you get those numbers, you can check here:
