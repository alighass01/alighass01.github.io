        <h2>Question 2</h2>
        
        <h3>
            Between the Siberian-escapee monkeyhounds, 
            the express freight locomotive, and a foot eaten alive by bugs, 
            my hazy and hiked-out mind was attempting to conprehend 
            an in-comprehendable situation unfolding before it. 
            To top it off, we had neighbors. And I don't know
            where to start with them. But a good word to descirbe their,
            um, essence would be:
            <br><br>
            _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
            <br><br>

        </h3>
