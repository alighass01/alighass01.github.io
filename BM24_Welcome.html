        <h2>
            Here's What's Up:
        </h2>

        <h3>
            A Quick Low Down:
        </h3>

        <p>
            There are <b>3 parts</b> to this year's Birthmas "celebration". How exciting? <br>
            If it gives you any comfort, I went wayyyyy easier on you this year <br>
            <br>
            AND, you already completed part uno. Pat yourself on the back for that mess. <br>
            <br>
            So let us talk about what comes next...
        </p>

        <h3>
            Us Talking About What Comes Next:
        </h3>

        <p>
            You are now in charge of completing <b>Part 2</b> and <b>Part 3</b>...NEWS FLASH! As one could expect, completing Part 2 will give you access to Part 3 <br>
            <br>
            Your next adventure is going to be using the included maps and this website for <i>something</i>. Starting on <br>
            the next page, you'll be completing a few sets of a few questions. These answers will relate to locations <br>
            on the maps. <b>Question Set 1</b> will relate to <b>Map 1</b> (genius, I know), <b>Set 2</b> to <b> Map 2</b>, and so on and so fourth. <br>
            <br>
            Four maps, four sets of questions. <br>
            <br>
            And as a helpful pointer, follow the order of questions to reveal whatever it is you are <i>revealing</i> ;^) <br>
            <br>
            At the end of the set of sets of questions, you will be directed to a final page to gain access to <b>Part 3</b>. <br>
            Because I am such a nice person, I have included quick access to all sets of questions, and the access to Part 3's "lockbox" below, <br>
            just so that you don't have to repeatedly input these answers until you're driven mad. 
        </p>

        <form action="https://google.com">
        <input type="submit" value="Access to Question Set 1" />

        <p>
            Ugh I'm so nice, right? Anyways, more instruction may or may not come later, but that is for future Bryce to determine. <br>
            Good luck, have fun, and may the odds be every in your favor. <br>
            <br>
            Oh oh oh. One final thing!! <br>
            Answers are <b>CASE SENSITIVE</b> and include spaces. Failure to comply will result in nuclear Armageddon. Thx <3
